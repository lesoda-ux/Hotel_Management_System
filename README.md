## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system before proceeding:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 17 or later, required to run the application.  
- **Apache Maven**: Used to install dependencies and build the project.
- **XAMPP**: Required to provide a local server environment with MySQL and Tomcat.  
- **Astah UML**: Required for viewing UML diagrams.  
- **IDE**: Required to read and understand code efficiently.  
- **PDF Reader**: Required to view the documents.  
- **Git**: Used to clone the repository.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   To download the repository and navigate to its directory:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/stefanocaramagno/Hotel_Management_System.git
   cd Hotel_Management_System
   ```

2. **Start MySQL Server**

   To launch the MySQL server using XAMPP:

      - **Windows**

         ```sh
         C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysqld --console
         ```

      - **Linux**

         ```sh
         sudo /opt/lampp/bin/mysql.server start
         ```

      - **macOS**

         ```sh
         sudo /opt/lampp/bin/mysql.server start
         ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   To install all required dependencies:

   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Server**

   To start the application:

   ```sh
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

2. **Access the Application**

   To open the application in your browser:

   ```sh
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

   This will take you to the homepage of the Hotel Management System.

### Testing the Application
